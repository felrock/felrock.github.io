*Alexa, how do i scrape wikipedia?*



I first read about [Path to Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) on a subreddit called r/dailyprogrammer,
if i remember correctly it was a posted as a medium difficult task. The rules are
quite simple, start at any wikipedia page, follow the first link in the **first
paragraph**, repeat until either Philosophy is reached or a loop is found.

First link meaning: the first link that isn't enclosed in bracers from the top of the main bread text. The reason for not including links within bracers is because they are
usually related to language pronounciation, which isn't revelant to the content of
the page. I've written a simple script that prints each page title until Philosophy
or a loop is found. Loop here means when a page links to a previously visted page,
this becomes a loop since the link is always the same of each page(unless someone
edits the page during script run-time, pretty unlikely).


Anyways, here is the link to the [script](https://github.com/felrock/path2philosophy). There are probably cases where it breaks, also it could be faster. I might optimize it for another idea I have where you select a source and destination wiki-page, and then create a graph for all links and related links. With this graph perform Djikstra's shortest path algorithm.
