This years Advent of Code was really interresting and the problems were well defined, and quite hard. My ambitions for this years challenges were to do more problems than I did last year, which I succeded to do. Gathering 42 golden stars this year and last year I got 36. For me to imporve my score for next year I think that spending some time trying to figure out the math behind the problems. Atleast for the problems in the end that are harder, the problems scale from easy to hard over the 25 day period. I have posted all the solutions I created on my [Github](https://github.com/felrock/Advent-of-Code-2020) written in C++.
